The paper describes a method of architecture description, based on the use of UML but with carefully selected metamodels. The metamodels allow a significant amount of consistency checking to be done early in the process of developing a system architecture description. Alloy is used to capture the formal meaning of the metamodels. Tools are described that allow this approach to be used in conjunction with established methods and tools. The tools and the approach support both incremental development and collaborative working, essential for developing the architecture description of large systems.
